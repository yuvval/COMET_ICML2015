% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass{article}

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{subfigure} 

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2015} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2015} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set

\usepackage{icml2015} 

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
